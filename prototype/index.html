            <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of NASA's space program. Eight monkeys
                had flown on NASA missions before him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.
            </p>
            <p>Gordo's historic flight took place on <em>December 13, 1958</em> when he took off from Cape Canaveral for
                a 15 minute flight into space. Even though he was weightless for over 8 minutes the on-board instruments
                indicated that Gordo enjoyed his journey into <strong>space</strong>. Scientists monitoring the flight
                were pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordo suffered from the entry into space was a
                modest slowing of his pulse. </p>

<h3>The Mission</h3>        
<P>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the 
Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral,
 travel further than any monkey had ever travelled before 
 over 1,500 miles - and reach a height of 310 miles (500 km) </P>
